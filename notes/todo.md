# Remaining Work

## Must Do
* set correct times/intervals for everything, consolidate into Danaides.h
* add valve status LEDs to base-station
* add late-receive checking/status LED to base-station for both pump-switch and remote-sensor
* convert remote-sensor to 3V trinket, remove ON led
* build remote-sensor battery holder
* build remote-sensor float & valve sensors

## Should Do
* balance brightness of LEDs & Alpha/Numeric displays
* add transmission checking/status LED to remote-sensor (pin 13)
* add transmission checking/status LED to pump-switch (pin 13)

## Nice To Have
* enable alarm beeping? w/switch to disable...
* add dimmer (potentiometer) to base-station display
* add local LED display of sensor states to remote-sensor (triggered by existing interrupt button)
