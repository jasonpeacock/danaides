# Remaining Work

## Must Do
* if sensors are late, disable logic/reset local pumpswitch/clear display?
* set correct times/intervals for everything, consolidate into Danaides.h
* build remote-sensor battery holder
* build remote-sensor float & valve sensors

## Should Do
* balance brightness of LEDs & Alpha/Numeric displays
* add transmission checking/status LED to remote-sensor (pin 13)
* add transmission checking/status LED to pump-switch (pin 13)

## Nice To Have
* enable alarm beeping? w/switch to disable...
* add dimmer (potentiometer) to base-station display
* add local LED display of sensor states to remote-sensor (triggered by existing interrupt button)
