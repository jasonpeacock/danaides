# Remaining Work

## Must Do
* set correct times/intervals for everything, consolidate into Danaides.h
* build remote-sensor battery holder
* build remote-sensor float & valve sensors
* remove pin13 LED from remote-sensor board
* change alpha display to show fixed words instead of scrolling
  * PUMP ON (timer), TANK FULL (no timer), PUMP OFF (timer)

## Should Do
* balance brightness of LEDs & Alpha/Numeric displays

## Nice To Have
* enable alarm beeping? w/switch to disable...
* add dimmer (potentiometer) to base-station display
* add local LED display of sensor states to remote-sensor (triggered by existing interrupt button)
